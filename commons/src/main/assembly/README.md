**Version: ${version}**

This is a set of libraries which can be used to write
- a web service client for the application (not required, can be done using any
  web service framework)

Furthermore, these libraries may be used to include the complete ER Verify Tool
into other Java 1.8 applications (not recommended).

For extending the application, please read chapter 4, "Creating an Additional
Validator" of the product documentation.
